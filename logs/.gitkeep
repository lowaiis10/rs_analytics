# This file ensures the logs/ directory exists in git
# while keeping actual log files out (via .gitignore)
#
# Log files created here:
# - rs_analytics.log (main application log)
# - etl_YYYYMMDD.log (daily ETL logs)
#
# Logs are rotated daily and kept for 30 days.
# This directory is ignored by git to prevent committing
# potentially sensitive log data.
